# Competitive Programming Challenge - 8 Weeks in C++

## Overview

Welcome to my Competitive Programming Challenge repository! This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming exercises that I tackled over an 8-week period. Each week focuses on a specific topic in C++, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques. This README provides an overview of the topics covered, the structure of the repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into eight main directories, each representing a week of the challenge. Inside each directory, you will find multiple exercises related to the week's topic. The structure is as follows:

## Chapters Overview

### Week 1: Using the STL
In this week, I focused on mastering the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Exercises cover various STL components like vectors, sets, maps, and algorithms such as sort, binary search, and more.

### Week 2: Graphs
This week is dedicated to basic graph theory concepts. Solutions include implementations of common graph algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and shortest path algorithms.

### Week 3: More on Graphs
Building on the previous week, this chapter dives deeper into advanced graph algorithms. Topics include Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms like Prim's and Kruskal's.

### Week 4: Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a crucial technique in competitive programming. This week covers fundamental DP problems, including memoization, tabulation, and common DP problems like knapsack, longest increasing subsequence, and more.

### Week 5: Advanced Data Structures
Advanced data structures such as segment trees, Fenwick trees (Binary Indexed Trees), and disjoint set union (DSU) are explored this week. Exercises demonstrate how to use these structures to solve complex problems efficiently.

### Week 6: Sliding Window Algorithms
The sliding window technique is powerful for solving problems involving subarrays or substrings. This week includes various exercises that utilize this technique to solve problems efficiently.

### Week 7: Geometry
This week is dedicated to computational geometry. Exercises cover topics such as convex hull, line intersection, polygon area calculation, and other geometric algorithms.

### Week 8: String Hash
String hashing is a technique used for efficient string comparison and pattern matching. This final week covers topics like rolling hash, Rabin-Karp algorithm, and other applications of string hashing.
